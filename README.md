# 🔎 VulnMan

**VulnMan** is a resource designed to **understand, structure, and approach a Vulnerability Management Plan (VMP)**.  
It provides a practical reference for security professionals, red teamers, and organizations who want to move from raw vulnerability data to actionable risk reduction.

---

## 🗺️ Overview
Vulnerability Management is not just scanning and patching.  
It’s a **continuous lifecycle** that requires prioritization, communication, and integration with business goals.

**VulnMan** covers:
- The **theory** behind vulnerability management (frameworks, compliance drivers, best practices).
- The **practical flows**: from asset discovery to remediation validation.
- **Hands-on resources** for building, testing, and improving your own VMP.

---

## 📑 Topics
- **Asset Inventory** — know what you protect
- **Vulnerability Discovery** — scans, pentests, threat intel
- **Risk Prioritization** — CVSS, exploitability, business impact
- **Remediation & Mitigation** — patching, config hardening, compensating controls
- **Verification** — re-testing, continuous monitoring
- **Reporting** — from technical findings to exec-ready summaries
- **Governance** — policies, roles, ownership, accountability
