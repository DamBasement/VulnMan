# Vulnerability Management Policy – Draft

## 1. Policy Overview
This policy establishes the framework for managing vulnerabilities within **[COMPANY]** IT infrastructure.  
Its purpose is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems through timely and effective **identification, evaluation, remediation, and mitigation** of vulnerabilities.

---

## 2. Purpose and Objectives
- Provide a consistent approach to vulnerability identification and remediation.  
- Reduce risk exposure by prioritizing critical vulnerabilities.  
- Align with industry best practices and standards (e.g., ISO 27001 A.12.6, NIST SP 800-40, CIS Controls v8).  
- Enable proactive defense against emerging threats.

---

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to **all IT assets** owned or operated by [COMPANY], including:  
- Networks and servers  
- Endpoints and mobile devices  
- Applications and databases  
- Cloud services and external APIs  

---

## 4. Definitions
- **Vulnerability:** A flaw or weakness that could be exploited to compromise system security.  
- **Remediation:** Permanent resolution (e.g., patching, configuration change).  
- **Mitigation:** Temporary control to reduce risk (e.g., firewall rule, disabling a service).  
- **CVSS:** Common Vulnerability Scoring System, used to prioritize vulnerabilities by severity.  

---

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):** Oversees the vulnerability management program and ensures compliance.  
- **Chief Information Officer (CIO):** Ensures integration of vulnerability management with IT strategy.  
- **Department Heads:** Ensure policy adherence within their business units.  
- **System Owners / Administrators:** Apply patches, mitigations, and provide timely remediation.  
- **Security Team:** Perform scans, analyze results, report findings, and track remediation progress.  

---

## 6. Vulnerability Identification
- **Routine Scans:** Monthly scans of all IT assets.  
- **Critical Assets:** Weekly scans of high-value/mission-critical systems.  
- **Ad-Hoc Scans:** Triggered by major security alerts, zero-day disclosures, or system changes.  
- **Penetration Testing:** Conducted at least annually and after major system changes.  
- **Threat Intelligence:** Integrate external feeds to detect emerging vulnerabilities.  

---

## 7. Vulnerability Prioritization
Based on **CVSS base score** plus **business context (asset criticality, exposure)**:  

- **Critical (9.0–10):** Remediate or mitigate within 48 hours.  
- **High (7.0–8.9):** Remediate or mitigate within 7 days.  
- **Medium (4.0–6.9):** Remediate or mitigate within 30 days.  
- **Low (0.1–3.9):** Remediate or mitigate within 90 days.  

---

## 8. Remediation and Exception Handling
- **Routine Patching:** Apply monthly security updates.  
- **Emergency Patching:** Apply within 24 hours for critical vulnerabilities.  
- **Mitigation:** Temporary measures (firewall, access restriction) when immediate remediation is not possible.  
- **Unpatchable Assets:** Apply segmentation, increased monitoring, or phased removal.  
- **Exception Process:** Documented approval required from CISO for any deviation from remediation timelines.  

---

## 9. Reporting and Metrics
- **Vulnerability Reports:** Delivered monthly to CISO, CIO, and relevant Department Heads.  
- **KPIs:**  
  - % of vulnerabilities remediated within SLA  
  - Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)  
  - Outstanding exceptions and compensating controls  
- **Executive Summaries:** Quarterly reports to CEO and Board.  

---

## 10. Enforcement and Escalation
Failure to comply with this policy will result in:  
- Immediate review of procedures.  
- Mandatory retraining for responsible personnel.  
- Escalation to senior management for further actions, up to disciplinary measures.  

---

## 11. Review and Continuous Improvement
This policy will be reviewed **annually** or earlier if:  
- Business processes change significantly  
- New regulatory requirements emerge  
- Major vulnerabilities impact critical systems  

---

## 12. Document Control

- **Date:** [Insert Date]  
- **Author:** [Policy Owner / Security Office]  
- **Next Review:** [Insert Date]
